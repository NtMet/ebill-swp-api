# ebill-swp-api

The **eBill Software Partner API** (eBill SWP API) defines an interface used to deliver _electronic invoices_
from an ERP to an _eBill Network Partner_ (as defined by SIX).

## Status

This repository should be considered as _work in progress_. It shows what direction such an API
could take. It is provided here only as a general information of the workgroup's reflections.
Documents should by no means be used to implement code or draw conclusions.

You are welcome to comment and/or discuss on the API by the way of _GitHub issues_.
