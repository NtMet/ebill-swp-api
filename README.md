# ebill-swp-api

The **eBill Software Partner API** defines an interface used to deliver _electronic invoices_
from an ERP to an _eBill Network Partner_ (as defined by SIX).

## Status

This repository should be considered as _work in progress_. It shows what direction such an API
could take. It is provided here only as a general information of the workgroup's reflections.
Documents should by no means be used to implement code or draw conclusions.

You are welcome to comment and/or discuss on the API by the way of _GitHub issues_.

## API definition

See [Empfehlung f√ºr die Schnittstelle zwischen Netzwerkpartnern der SIX eBill und
Softwareherstellern](https://github.com/swico/ebill-swp-api/blob/master/documents/SchnittstellenempfehlungSIXeBill-DRAFT-0.1.pdf) for the current draft recommendation
(only available in German).

The API definition can be found as a Swagger YAML-file in folder `api` and viewed,
for instance, with an online tool such as [swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io).

The [onboarding process](https://github.com/swico/ebill-swp-api/tree/master/documents/onboarding.md)
